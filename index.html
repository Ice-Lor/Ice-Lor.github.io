            The "UIA Cat," also known as the "OIIA Cat" or "Oo Ee A E A Cat," 
            is a viral internet meme featuring a spinning gray tabby cat named Ethel. 
            This meme gained popularity through its association with a catchy, 
            nonsensical vocalization resembling "oo ee ah ee ah," 
            often set to various remixed songs.
